JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

JSON syntax:

Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

eg:
{
    "Students":[
        {"rollno":1, "name": "abcd"},
        {"rollno":2, "name": "xyz"},
        {"rollno":3, "name": "xyw"}
    ]
}
